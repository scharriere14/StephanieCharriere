<h1>Stephanie Charriere</h1>
<ul>
<p>Hi, I'm a Business Information Technology graduate from Red River College with a passion for solving technical problems and optimizing processes. I enjoy learning through trial and error, and I’m always looking for ways to make systems work better—whether that’s through clean code, efficient database design, or secure application development. My goal is to turn curiosity into impact, especially in fields like cybersecurity and backend development.
<br><br>
  My experience includes working on real-world industry projects, like helping the Winnipeg Jazz Orchestra streamline their registration and database systems. I’ve built full-stack applications, explored cloud computing with AWS, and used tools like Docker, SQL, and C# to bring ideas to life. Security and practicality are top priorities for me—I care just as much about protecting data as I do about making apps user-friendly and efficient.
  <br><br>
  Outside of tech, I’m someone who values simplicity, hard work, and balance. Whether I’m chasing personal goals like maintaining a tidy home, spending time with my family, or learning something new, I believe small, steady steps lead to big outcomes. Thanks for stopping by—feel free to look around or reach out if you’d like to connect.</p><br><br>
